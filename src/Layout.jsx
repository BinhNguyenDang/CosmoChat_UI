// The Outlet component is a unique feature of React Router that serves as a placeholder where child routes are rendered. It acts as a container for nested routes defined within the parent route component. When a route matches its path, the components associated with the nested routes are rendered inside the Outlet. Essentially, it provides a way to render child components dynamically based on the current route, enabling hierarchical routing within React applications.
/* Outlet:
    Outlet is a fundamental component provided by React Router. It serves as a placeholder within the route hierarchy where child routes are rendered.
    When a route component contains an Outlet, it acts as a location where the child routes defined within that parent component will be rendered.
    Essentially, Outlet enables nested routing in React applications. It allows us to define a hierarchy of routes and render components dynamically based on the current URL path.
    Without Outlet, it would be challenging to render nested routes because there wouldn't be a designated space to display them within the parent route component.
    By using Outlet, we can create complex routing structures with ease, organizing our application's UI into logical sections that correspond to different URL paths.
